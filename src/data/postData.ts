      'In the world we have always heard the saying ‘more money, more problems’, but what if I told you ‘problems will solve your money’, would you believe it? In the Kingdom world we come to see that when we are diligent and faithful with the small things, the Lord will trust us with much more.',
      'In this sermon Pastor Adam mentions how what we have comes from God, with this realization we have to steward what has been given to us, diligently. The reflection of our stewardship shows how much of a revelation we have that God is the source of it all.',
      'God is in control and all of it belongs to the Lord. When one realizes that ‘All I got is from the Lord’ the perspective changes on the dynamic between problems and money. Something we have to realize is that God is not desperate for recognition. He doesn’t need credit for your life. God Has No Needs. However, when one places their heart on other things outside of God, he will reinforce his reputation as a provider in your life. This can be done in a variety of ways. His reputation of being faithful, and being a provider. “I’m there for you, I got you, everything I got is from me, I’ll provide”.',
      'Jesus is most concerned with your heart. Where your treasure is your heart will be. If I go after your treasure I’ll get your heart. He’s not concerned about your desires(money, fame). Concerned where your heart is and how you acknowledge Him. The Lord is a righteously jealous God, who deserves all glory and focus!',
      'We want to build a principle life (roots that grow down deep). A foundation that’s firm, a bedrock that’s unshakable through biblical principles. Example of business principles: Best products always solve the biggest problems. If you aim at fixing problems you’ll always hit money. Example of biblical principles: Do not judge you won’t be judged, do not condemn and you won’t be condemned, forgive and you will be forgiven.',
      'A biblical principle is a fundamental truth that produces a divine system of cooperation between Heaven and me. When God gives a promise he’ll do it in spite of you. A principle requires some action (cooperation) if you participate it will come into effect.',
      'There are other lawys like Natural laws that require nothing, a spiritual or biblical law requires your involvement, however. As I give, it comes back to me, this requires my participation. For a new level of grace had to be a new level of measure, the blood of the lamb, more than necessary (running over) was what was given to me. He let’s you take the lead of what you think is generosity, love, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, patience, dirtiness. Give with your heart. Give what you have decided in your heart to give. I owe it to the King, why wouldnt I give him my best. He loves when you give it from your heart and not the head, for it is the heart He is after!',

      'In this message, Begin, we discover how grace not only offers us a fresh start but propels us forward with a head start. Don’t miss the opportunity to be a part of a Vision fulfilled and the calling the Lord has on your life.',
      'In Ephesians 3:16 we see that the Lord is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us. This is a powerful reminder that the Lord is able to do more than we could ever ask or imagine.',
      'This brings us the revelation forth that we are better than we think. We are better than we can ever imagine. Not by anything we have done or can do, but by the immense power and glory of God that lives within us.',
      'Paul pushes and emphasizes this reminder to the believers of what we have in Christ. The reason Paul goes in depth in this area is because many believers who become condemned by sins, addictions, fear, anxieties and vices of the world feel trapped and have a tendency to feel like theyre going back to a fresh new start.',
      'However, what if grace is not just a starting point, but much more? What if grace is a head start? What if grace is a head start to the calling the Lord has on your life? What if grace is a head start to the vision the Lord has for you?',
      'Although a bump on the road, or a setback may feel like youre starting all over again. This is not the case based on the argument that Paul makes. The enemies plan is simple, to use your past, your shame and sin to think youre in a deficit. His goal is discouragement to be in self-defeat.',
      'Since we already have the victory in Christ, he cannot defeat you. His best tactic is for you to give up and defeat yourself. Grace is a head start, a place of proximity to the King. Due to his sacrifice we can enter the Holy of Holies, there is no need for us to sit in the outercourt. We can always begin in the most holy place, because the Lord is holy, we are therefore Holy.'

      'In Luke 16:1-14 we see the parable of the dishonest manager. This parable is a powerful reminder that we are called to be good stewards of the resources that God has given us. We are called to be faithful with what we have been given, no matter how much or how little that may be.',
      'We come to see that money is a tool that can be used for good or for evil. It can be a master or a servant. It can be a source of stress or a source of blessing. It all depends on how we choose to use it. We must be good stewards of the resources that God has given us.',
      'In the sermon we see that moeny is an incredible tool when it doesnt intoxicate your thinking. Not every decision has to be based off of profit. If youre thinking this way, you are not thinking like a steward. You are thinking like a master. We must be careful with how we view money and how we use it.',
      'Anything that we try and have control over, will have control over us. This applies to all things, but especially money. When you grasp it for control and for tightness, it will have control over your thoughts, mind and ultimately your heart.',
      'We are meant to be givers in every spehere. A giver always has a lose hand and is willing to give freely. Never holding tightly to what he does not own. I know I am not controlled by it if I can release it.',
      'Money is not inherently evil, but the love of money is. STEWARDSHIP MAKES MARGIN FOR THE MIRACULOUS. Miracles happen when we steward correctly. We must be faithful with what we have been given, no matter how much or how little that may be. Margin is a result of trust + faithfulness',
      'The question we must ask ourselves is am I a good manager with what I have been entrusted with? If not, where can I improve? Money is a seed, the goal of a seed is not storage. You sow the seed your produce.',

      'Something we have to understand is that misunderstanding tools for hygene can end up hurting us in ways we couldnt think of. This is typically the case with misunderstanding forgiveness.',
      'As believers and people who follow Christ we know we must forgive. Sometimes however, we think we have forgiven, but it could be we have forgotten instead.',
      'When conflict arises, the offense needs to be defined by the individual. If its not it cant be addressed. When we dont address the conflict we begin to create fences around us and others.',
      'The longer the fence, the bigger the fence, the harder it will be to take the walls down. One way to knnow what forgiveness is, is to evaluate what is not. Some things is not: 1. Ignoring/forgetting, 2. Not tolerating, 3. Reconciliation.',
      'Forgiveness is not tolerating, but accepting what has occured and still forgiving. Reconciliation involves that two parties forgive. However, this is not always the case if situations are hostile, unhealthy and against your well-being.',
      'How do we achieve this level of forgiveness when one has hurt us? We can begin this level of faith by looking at the cross. The Lord mentions he has forgiven our transgressions and iniquities from East to West. He choses to not remember them. Does this mean he cant, of course not as the Lord is omniscent and knows all. That is the love of the Lord.',
      'Our forgiveness from Christ can never be paid back. He paid a debt he didnt owe. By his grace and mercy we have been forgiven. WE MUST FORGIVE OTHERS. How can a person pay you back when you have placed them in prison? This is the concept of unforgiveness.',
      'Youre going to have a lifetime of forgiveness to practice and get used too. We must practice forgiveness and learn to release it like a muscle. Breathe in and breathe out, for forgiveness brings freedom and joy in Christ that cannot be bought. The calculation of our character is seen  on the cross. God calculus for forgiveness is greater than our calculation could ever be.'

We are called to share with the Lord’s people who are in need and to practice hospitality. We are called to bless those who persecute us; bless and do not curse. We are called to rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. We are called to live in harmony with one another. We are called to not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. We are called to not be conceited.',
      'In particular we pay attention to the power that the Lord has given us via our own words. We have the power to speak life or death into the world. This power comes at a great cost because we can either bless or curse. The Lord calls us higher, that even during persecution we must bless those who are trying to hurt us.',

      'Since our words are a reflection of whats living inside of us it truly puts into perspective who we really are. Through our words our character is ultimately discovered. Character discovery can be discovered through our language. Could lying be potentially preventing you from finding your identity in Christ? Would telling the truth then make you think about heavenly things and the Kingdom at hand?',
      'According to the Word this is clear. Since lying is the language of the adversary, we must be careful with what we say. We must be careful with what we say because it is a direct reflection of what we are letting mold us. WE MUST BE AGENTS OF TRUTH.',
