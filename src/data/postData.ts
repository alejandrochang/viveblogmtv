      'Its the thought that counts. In this second installment of our Main Character series, we are reminded that we are not the main character of our story, Jesus is. Pastor Adam takes things a step further and gives us the tools to build our character by faith. This message will call you higher to be convicted, fully convinced in the core of our faith.',
      'In Romans we see Paul giving us the clarity into how were responsible for what we think and how we act. Because we have freewill we also have power to ultimately chose what we do. Based on this there is weight to our decisions and ultimately a responsibility to our actions.',
      'In Romans 12:3 it makes it clear that "God has distributed a measure of faith to each one", referring to all of us. This measure of faith is what propels us to do the Kingdom work that God has called us to do. This faith is what allows us to be convicted and fully convinced in the core of our faith.',
      'In the previous installment we talked about how the Renewing of the Mind is what propels us to our instrinsic character. So where does character come from? We can take a deeper look that character comes from our soul which is comprised of the mind, will and emotions.',
      'When we talk about being transformed by the Spirit we come to see that the Holy Spirit wants to do the work on our soul. This is how were able to change within ourselves and ultimately our character. This change has to be at the depths of who we are. The depths of who we are will propel us to the thoughts we have, whether righteous or unrighteous thoughts.',
      'Something we have to come to understand, is that living in the world over time shows us that everything around is an influennce. Whether we want to acept it or not. This means that we are constantly being targeted to be brainwashed by sin. This is incredibly important to the believer to again take hold of the mind of Christ to be able to combat these spiritual and focus on "thoughts above".',
      'With our mind focused on christ, in a process of renewing we see that to be Godly is to have Godly thoughts. This is what the "transformation of the mind" is all about. This is what will allow us to be able to be convicted and fully convinced in the core of our faith.',
      'Character drives the personality, and its a dynamic process. To change the way we think we have to start living like Christ. When faced with challenges such as temptation we must know that it is trying to put weight on our character, but that character transformation is what leads us into sanctification.',
      'Faith is dynamic, we sholdnt stay in the same measure of faith we were originally given. Through the listening of the Word of God our minds will be renwed. As the Word is the very thoughts of God that propels us to that calling the Lord has called us from the beginnning of time.'
