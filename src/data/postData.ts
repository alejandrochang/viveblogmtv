It’s a call to recognize that our words are a direct reflection of what’s within.',
      'In Romans 12:12-17 we see that we are called to be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, and faithful in prayer. We are called to share with the Lord’s people who are in need and to practice hospitality. We are called to bless those who persecute us; bless and do not curse. We are called to rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. We are called to live in harmony with one another. We are called to not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. We are called to not be conceited.',
      'In particular we pay attention to the power that the Lord has given us via our own words. We have the power to speak life or death into the world. This power comes at a great cost because we can either bless or curse. The Lord calls us higher, that even during persecution we must bless those who are trying to hurt us.',
      'We come to see that Luke 6:45 says that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks". This is a clear indication that our words are a direct reflection of what is within us. This is why we must be careful with what we say, because it is a direct reflection of our character and ultimately our heart posture.',
      'Since our words are a reflection of whats living inside of us it truly puts into perspective who we really are. Through our words our character is ultimately discovered. Character discovery can be discovered through our language. Could lying be potentially preventing you from finding your identity in Christ? Would telling the truth then make you think about heavenly things and the Kingdom at hand?',
      'According to the Word this is clear. Since lying is the language of the adversary, we must be careful with what we say. We must be careful with what we say because it is a direct reflection of what we are letting mold us. WE MUST BE AGENTS OF TRUTH.',
      'The Lord says I am the truth and the life. The keys to the Kingdom is found in the truth for us to operate at our full identity in Christ, to operate in the fullness of the Kingdom. When we lie we lose our keys, ultimately our authority and even our identity in Christ.',
      'We act according to our thoughts so meditate on what is good, focus on the language of truth. As you speak truth and abide in truth, your mind is renewed by the truth allowing you the hear the fullness of Gods plan for your life to operate at the God Given scale the Lord wants us to operate in.'

      'Authenntic Christianity? What is it, how can we achieve it and what does it look like? In this message we are reminded that we are not the main character of our story, Jesus is. Pastor Keira Smallcombe brings us a message based on Romans 12 that shapes our understanding of authentic Christianity. “The Real Thing” paints a picture of how God wants us to love. Press play and let a zealous love work in your life.',
      'In Romans 12:9-12 we begin to see what Paul describes as true christianity. He describes it as a love that is genuine, a love that is not hypocritical. This is the love that we are called to have for one another. This is the love that we are called to have for the Lord and for his people.',
      'We come to see that love can be with hypocrisy, can be fake. Only through the Lord we are able to receive the pure, unfiltered, highest form of love. God cares about the quality of LOVE. AGAPE love is the gold standard for love. ',
      'Genuine love comes from the heart, through Jesus. There are different types of love, and the one we should strive for is Agape, based on the greatest example Jesus gave us through his sacrifice. The Lord chose to love us, a decision that was made before the foundation of the world. We have to follow this example and CHOSE TO LOVE FULL OF OUR HEART.',
      'In 1 John 4:7-12 we see that God is love. This is the love that we are called to have for one another. This is the love that we are called to have for the Lord and for his people. Only through knowing God you will be able to give this love. It is impossible to give this love without knowing Jesus as the Word clearly describes.',
      'We must not torelate evil. Tolerance of evil is an absence of full love. Through love we are able to make a clear seperation between what is from God(Love) and what is from the World. Love is not just a feeling, it is a decision. Love is not attached to oucomes or human responnses. Real Love Works. We need to let love work (zeal). A true love will be fervent in spirit, passionate about serving the one you love.',
      'We love because the Lord loved us first. Love starts with a decision to love nno matter the circumstance. This truest form of love can only come from the King.'

      'In Romans we see Paul giving us the clarity into how were responsible for what we think and how we act. Because we have freewill we also have power to ultimately chose what we do. Based on this there is weight to our decisions and ultimately a responsibility to our actions.',
      'In Romans 12:3 it makes it clear that "God has distributed a measure of faith to each one", referring to all of us. This measure of faith is what propels us to do the Kingdom work that God has called us to do. This faith is what allows us to be convicted and fully convinced in the core of our faith.',
      'In the previous installment we talked about how the Renewing of the Mind is what propels us to our instrinsic character. So where does character come from? We can take a deeper look that character comes from our soul which is comprised of the mind, will and emotions.',
      'When we talk about being transformed by the Spirit we come to see that the Holy Spirit wants to do the work on our soul. This is how were able to change within ourselves and ultimately our character. This change has to be at the depths of who we are. The depths of who we are will propel us to the thoughts we have, whether righteous or unrighteous thoughts.',
      'Something we have to come to understand, is that living in the world over time shows us that everything around is an influennce. Whether we want to acept it or not. This means that we are constantly being targeted to be brainwashed by sin. This is incredibly important to the believer to again take hold of the mind of Christ to be able to combat these spiritual and focus on "thoughts above".',
      'With our mind focused on christ, in a process of renewing we see that to be Godly is to have Godly thoughts. This is what the "transformation of the mind" is all about. This is what will allow us to be able to be convicted and fully convinced in the core of our faith.',
      'Character drives the personality, and its a dynamic process. To change the way we think we have to start living like Christ. When faced with challenges such as temptation we must know that it is trying to put weight on our character, but that character transformation is what leads us into sanctification.',
      'Faith is dynamic, we sholdnt stay in the same measure of faith we were originally given. Through the listening of the Word of God our minds will be renwed. As the Word is the very thoughts of God that propels us to that calling the Lord has called us from the beginnning of time.'
